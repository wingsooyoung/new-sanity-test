encapsulating and managing state. Applies an accumulator (or \"reducer function\")\n * to each value from the source after an initial state is established -- either via\n * a `seed` value (second argument), or from the first value from the source.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">It's like {@link reduce}, but emits the current\n * accumulation state after each update</span>\n *\n * ![](scan.png)\n *\n * This operator maintains an internal state and emits it after processing each value as follows:\n *\n * 1. First value arrives\n *   - If a `seed` value was supplied (as the second argument to `scan`), let `state = seed` and `value = firstValue`.\n *   - If NO `seed` value was supplied (no second argument), let `state = firstValue` and go to 3.\n * 2. Let `state = accumulator(state, value)`.\n *   - If an error is thrown by `accumulator`, notify the consumer of an error. The process ends.\n * 3. Emit `state`.\n * 4. Next value arrives, let `value = nextValue`, go to 2.\n *\n * ## Examples\n *\n * An average of previous numbers. This example shows how\n * not providing a `seed` can prime the stream with the\n * first value from the source.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { of, scan, map } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const numbers$ = of(1, 2, 3);\n *\n * numbers$\n *   .pipe(\n *     // Get the sum of the numbers coming in.\n *     scan((total, n) => total + n),\n *     // Get the average by dividing the sum by the total number\n *     // received so far (which is 1 more than the zero-based index).\n *     map((sum, index) => sum / (index + 1))\n *   )\n *   .subscribe(console.log);\n * ```\n *\n * The Fibonacci sequence. This example shows how you can use\n * a seed to prime accumulation process. Also... you know... Fibonacci.\n * So important to like, computers and stuff that its whiteboarded\n * in job interviews. Now you can show them the Rx version! (Please don't, haha)\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { interval, scan, map, startWith } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const firstTwoFibs = [0, 1];\n * // An endless stream of Fibonacci numbers.\n * const fibonacci$ = interval(1000).pipe(\n *   // Scan to get the fibonacci numbers (after 0, 1)\n *   scan(([a, b]) => [b, a + b], firstTwoFibs),\n *   // Get the second number in the tuple, it's the one you calculated\n *   map(([, n]) => n),\n *   // Start with our first two digits :)\n *   startWith(...firstTwoFibs)\n * );\n *\n * fibonacci$.subscribe(console.log);\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link expand}\n * @see {@link mergeScan}\n * @see {@link reduce}\n * @see {@link switchScan}\n *\n * @param accumulator A \"reducer function\". This will be called for each value after an initial state is\n * acquired.\n * @param seed The initial state. If this is not provided, the first value from the source will\n * be used as the initial state, and emitted without going through the accumulator. All subsequent values\n * will be processed by the accumulator function. If this is provided, all values will go through\n * the accumulator function.\n * @return A function that returns an Observable of the accumulated values.\n */\nexport function scan<V, A, S>(accumulator: (acc: V | A | S, value: V, index: number) => A, seed?: S): OperatorFunction<V, V | A> {\n  // providing a seed of `undefined` *should* be valid and trigger\n  // hasSeed! so don't use `seed !== undefined` checks!\n  // For this reason, we have to check it here at the original call site\n  // otherwise inside Operator/Subscriber we won't know if `undefined`\n  // means they didn't provide anything or if they literally provided `undefined`\n  return operate(scanInternals(accumulator, seed as S, arguments.length >= 2, true));\n}\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"6c11b05c497f6190ddc1b117edb923fc","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
